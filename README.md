# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project aims to predict credit defaults using a Decision Tree Classifier model. The dataset used for this project is the "Credit Card Default Prediction" dataset.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and cleaning the data by handling missing values and converting categorical variables to numerical representations.
2. **Feature Correlation Analysis:** Investigating the correlation between different features to identify important predictors.
3. **Data Visualization:** Visualizing the data using plots to gain insights into the distribution of variables and identify outliers.
4. **Predictive Modeling:** Building a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict credit defaults.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy score.
6. **Decision Tree Visualization:** Visualizing the decision tree to understand the model's decision-making process.
7. **Prediction on Test Dataset:** Applying the trained model to predict credit defaults on a separate test dataset.
8. **Submission:** Creating a submission file with the predicted credit default probabilities.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the code in this project:

* pandas
* numpy
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* graphviz

You can install these libraries using pip: `pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn graphviz`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: git clone `https://github.com/anatarajank/Credit_Card_Default_Prediction`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Aravindan_IS_Training_Project.ipynb`.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code.

## Results

The Decision Tree Classifier model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy score] on the test dataset.
